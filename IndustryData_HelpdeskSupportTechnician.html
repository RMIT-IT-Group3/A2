          <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          <p>My ideal role is that of a desktop services administrator, or helpdesk support. I feel that a technical support role would combine my 15+ years of customer service experience with my learned IT skills. The desktop services administrator role that I found on Seek.com.au has a high level of customer service, with a focus on process improvement and innovation.</p>
          <p>According to Burning Glass Technologies Top IT Occupations List of 2018 (BGTOCCs), ‘Help Desk Officer’ ranks as the 5th most advertised positions with 9,416 out of 121,997. The transition to ‘work from home’ arrangements in the wake of the global response to COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a surge in growth for the IT industry. The Job Outlook website shows strong growth forecast for the ICT Support Technicians with a current employee size of 65,300 workers (joboutlook.gov.au 2020). The gender share is only 22% female and with gender diversity a huge focus for most industries, particularly the Australian government’s <i>Advancing Women in STEM</i> strategy, now is a good time to get into the industry.</p>

                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
                        <p>Having reviewed the data from Burning Glass, my opinion of my ideal job hasn’t changed. I feel that I possess a lot of the soft skills required to be successful in this role, and I have made progress in building the hard skills as well.</p>
                        <p>The data has highlighted to me the need to have a solid foundation in programming languages and SQL. These skills seem to be prevalent in a number of IT professions so learning these skills now will give me an advantage should the opportunity for a helpdesk support technician role come up.</p>
