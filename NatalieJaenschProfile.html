					<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					<p>I was born in Warragul, Victoria, in December 1987. I graduated from Trafalgar High School in 2005. Unlike many of my peers, I had not decided what I wanted to do, career-wise, so I opted to get a job rather than go to university straight away. My first job was as a trainee law clerk at a law firm in Traralgon. It sparked an interest in law, so I completed my Certificate IV in Business Administration as a pathway to study law. My plans were put on hold when I discovered that I was expecting my first child. My son was born in December 2007, just shy of my 20th birthday. From the time my son was 12 months old until when my daughter was born in 2010, I worked as a law clerk at a firm in Morwell. When I re-entered the workforce in 2013, I worked as an administrative assistant at an accounting firm in Morwell.</p>
					<p>It was when I took the job at the Morwell accounting firm that I discovered my interest in IT. The firm was transitioning from using Reckon APS for their accounting preparation software to Xero, which is a Cloud-based accounting system. I was the champion for this process and worked closely with the developers to complete the transition efficiently and successfully. Similarly, the Traralgon-based accounting firm that I began working for in 2017 also underwent a transitionary process. I was nominated as the process champion due to my previous experience and my technical skills and interest. Again, I worked closely with the developers to ensure that this process was smooth. Transitioning almost one million documents from one application to another required a lot of back-end mapping, but ultimately a good result was achieved. I believe that it was my keen interest in IT and my ability to learn these technical skills quickly that assisted with ensuring this good result.</p>

					<h2>Team Profile</h2>

					<h3>Myer-Briggs: INTJ</h3>
					<p>The results of my Myer-Briggs Personality Test concluded that I am an INTJ or the Architect personality type. An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.” The INTJ personality type is the rarest of the 16 types, making up two per cent of the population. Female INTJs are even rarer, making up just 0.8%. People with this personality type are best suited to IT careers owing to their ability to convert complex principles into clear and actionable strategies. </p>

					<h3>Learning Style: Pragmatist/Theorist</h3>
					<p>According to the results of the learning style test, I am 40.2% Pragmatic and 40.2% Theorist. Pragmatists prefer the practical approach, needing to be able to put their learning into practice in the real world. The pragmatic approach to learning includes the use of practicals, case studies, problem sets, and discussions. Theorists prefer to think through their problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity. Learning methods suited to theorists are models, classroom response systems, story-telling and quotes, and tutorials.</p>

					<h3>Fisher Temperament Inventory</h3>
					<p>The Fisher Temperament Inventory (FTI) is a measure of personality based on the idea that an individual’s behaviour is influenced by the dominance of particular neurotransmitters in the brain. The FTI identifies four chemical subsystems of the brain - dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and oestrogen - and measures four scales of behaviour believed to be produced by those systems, to give a result on an overall temperament type. The FTI test consists of 62 statements that the individual rates on a four-point scale of how much they agree with each statement. My answer profile matches most strongly to the Cautious/Social Norm Compliant temperament. This temperament is dominated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is involved in relaxation and social belonging. People with this temperament are orderly and careful. They like to fit in with their social group and are wary of people who deviate. They are loyal.</p>

					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>There is consistency in each of the results of the tests. Each of them describes me as taking a logical, pragmatic, cautious approach to matters which I believe is why I am drawn to law, accounting and IT. I do not feel the results would influence my behaviours in terms of conduct or treatment of others in the team. However, because the results provide a level of clarity about what motivates me and the reasons behind particular behaviours, it may influence decisions such as volunteering to undertake a task or project if it suits my strengths.</p>
					<p> From a management standpoint, I believe these tests offer a valuable insight into the mindset and personality traits of the person taking them, which can help when assembling special project teams or staff structures.</p>

					<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
					<p>I am quite open-minded when it comes to what my ideal job in IT would be. My initial thoughts are that I would like a technical support/help desk role because I feel that it would combine my vast customer service experience with my learned IT skills. My ideal job would give me exposure to different problems and issues and allow me to maximise the use of the skills and knowledge gained from my tertiary learning.</p>
					<p>I found a Desktop Services Administrator position advertised on Seek.com.au. The role has a high level of customer service via face-to-face and telephone methods, with a focus on process improvement and innovation to provide a better experience for the customers. I have previous experience in finance and accounting, so the industry is not entirely unfamiliar to me. The advertised role is for a large organisation with multiple locations. A role in a large multi-faceted organisation appeals to me because, aside from flexibility, there tends to be more opportunity to professional development and growth within the organisation that often does not exist in smaller businesses. The advertised role calls for experiences in several specific products and systems, such as Microsoft Back Office products, ServiceNow and Patch management, and ITIL frameworks. In addition to technical knowledge, the role requires demonstrated experience with face to face customer service in a dynamic, product-driven environment.</p>
					<p>I have high-level customer service skills, and I also believe that my interpersonal and communication skills would be well suited to this position. The role calls for a candidate who is approachable, empathetic and helpful, which I feel are qualities that I possess. Coming from an accounting background has given me much exposure to people who are often feeling frustrated with organisations such as the ATO. The ability to understand complex governmental processes and then convey them to clients sympathetically and concisely is a critical skill that I have developed over my career, which I feel would be an asset to this particular role.</p>
