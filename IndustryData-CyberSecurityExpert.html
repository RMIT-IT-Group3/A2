                  <h2>Ideal Job </h2>
                  <p>According to the industry data provided by burning glass technologies my selected ideal job of cyber security expert falls under the data classification of cyber / information security engineer / analyst. This classification ranks #13 in the burning glass occupations data report <i>(Burning Glass International 2018)</i>.</p>


									<hr class="major" />

                  <h2>IT-Specific Skills</h2>
                  <p>IT specific skills for a cyber security a professional will vary due to the profession having many sub-disciplines(Dice Insights, 2020),There is however baseline specific skills that are required, these include : A deep understanding of operating systems such as Linux and Windows, Networking and virtualization knowledge, software analytical skills and the ability to understand and use programming languages.(Dice Insights, 2020)<br>
                  The 3 core IT-specific skills – project management, SQL, and Microsoft Windows – are ranked within the top 5 skills in greatest demand by Burning Glass Technologies (Burning Glass International 2018).The burning glass data indicates that these skills are in demand by employers with knowledge in JAVA and Javascript ranking at #2 and #3</p>
                  <p>The specific skills that rank highest in demand by employers that are not in my ideal job’s required skill set would be SAP, Business Management and Graphic Design. The aforementioned skills would rarely be useful to an industry professional in cyber security.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>General Skills</h2>
									<p>A cyber security professional, and in particular the job posting I chose of cyber security expert, would require strong communication skills, problem solving and organisational skills. A professional will likely be made to work with a team and communicate to individuals about security concerns that may have little to no understanding of technology. Problem solving goes hand in hand with a cyber security role, finding ways in which to engineer and implement solutions to security problems.   (Dice Insights, 2020) Organisational skills are a must particularly within the selected role as the job posting indicates

									 “You will be operating across multiple initiatives executing in parallel and is expected to be able to prioritise and self-manage commitments.” (Job Description Cyber Security Specialist, 2020)

										</blockquote>

                These 3 skills alone are the top 3 ranked skills in demand from employers according to the burning class industry data.<br> Further in demand skills for this role are: Teamwork, troubleshooting, time management, meeting deadlines, analytical skills, multi-tasking, research and leadership.</p>
								<p>The three highest ranked general skills that are not in my required skill set are Creativity, self-starter and mentoring. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</h2>
									<p>After viewing the Burning Glass Data, I view my ideal job in a new light.
									While my ideal jobs classification ranks only as #13 amongst employers (Burning Glass International 2018) the specific and the general skills needed rank very high with employers. The high ranking of the jobs skills allows me to see the pursuit of this job title or career path as beneficial even if I do end up working in a completely different field as the skills I will learn in the pursuit are highly sought by potential employers.
