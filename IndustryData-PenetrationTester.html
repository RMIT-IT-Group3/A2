                  <b>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</b>
									<p>Penetration testers are in very high demand and have been stated that around 23% of organisations have reported a shortage of Penetration Testers (Pen testers) as according to a joint research conducted by the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) and Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG). On the list of where Cybersecurity skills have a shortage, Pen Testers are ranked fourth on the list for most in demand by employers in the Cybersecurity field.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<b>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b>
									<p>Penetration tester IT specific skills also rank high in terms of demand, such as the use of SQL, JavaScript, Java (the two aren't the same thing), Microsoft Windows, and Project Management. The highest skills needed for a Penetration tester are ranked lower in demand because Pen testers is a niche field such as LINUX and Python, but in the order for a Penetration tester would be Linux, Python, SQL, Javascript, website production, software engineering, microsoft windows, c#, java and git.</p>
<hr class="major" />
									<b>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</b>

									<p>The general skills that a Penetration Tester that is required to have are ranked very high in terms of demand from employers according to the Burning Glass Data, Pen testers are required to have good Communication Skills, problem solving skills, good writing skills, to able to work effectively in a team, be able to troubleshoot, be detail-orientated to see problems, also need to be creative to be able to find new ways of getting into systems and research to keep up to date with new security systems.</p>
 <p>Communication skills are by far in the highest demand with Problem-Solving trailing behind in second, and out of the top ten skills in highest demand, eight are required to be a Penetration Tester.</p>

									<hr class="major" />


									<b>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</b>
									<p>The highest three would be SAP (Systems Applications and Products) since Penetration Testers won't have extensive knowledge of SAP systems so SAP systems will need a SAP specialist, Business management and graphic design.</p>

									<hr class="major" />


									<b>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</b>
									<p>Organisation skills, planning and leadership skills are the three that have ranked highest out of the skills not required. These skills may be needed in some form when being a Penetration Tester but aren't the most critical skills.</p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<b>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</b>
									<p>My opinion has changed but in a good way, it has shown that I'll need to learn more in demand skills and that if I am able to learn the skills required to be a Penetration Tester then my skills will be in very high demand from employers, but i do have a long way to go.</p>
