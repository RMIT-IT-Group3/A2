                  <h2>What will Autonomous Vehicles do? </h2>

                  <p>As humanity’s understanding and scope of technology advances, so too does our capability to improve upon what already exists, usually to meet our need for efficiency and comfort. Vehicles have long been our poster boy for said improvements with newer and better models created and mass produced each year, with the sole aim of outdoing what already exists. From the horse-drawn cart, to the first car, to manual, to automatic, and now semi-autonomous (think <i>cruise control</i>), it feels like completely autonomous vehicles are a natural stepping stone in the evolution of vehicles. Complete autonomy in vehicles does not yet exist, but we aren’t far off.</p>
									<br>
									<p>As aforementioned, there is a current level of autonomy with current day vehicles, often advertised as the epitome of luxury and wealth, restricting the latest technological advances to those that can afford it. A prime example of this is demonstrated by well-known vehicle manufacturer, Tesla. Expensive and sleek cars proudly displayed on the manufacturer’s website, for those that can afford a Tesla, they have access to the latest in semi-autonomous machine programming in the form of the below features (Tesla autopilot, 2019)</p>


                  <p style="margin-left: 40px">• Automatic Emergency Braking Designed to detect objects that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly.
                  <br>
                  •	Automatic High Beams, Adjusts high/low beams as required.
									<br>
									•	Side and Front Collision Warning, Warns the driver of potential collisions with obstacles alongside the car, and of impending collisions with slower moving or stationary cars.
									</p>
                  <p>Vehicles with the capability to predict collisions and stop the vehicle without so much as a verbal command from the driver, Tesla is slowly scaling back the physical input required from a human driver through these features, without completely cutting human input out of the equation. Tesla is only one of many luxury vehicle manufacturers upping the ante, with the intent of bringing full autonomy to the streets. On April 2, 2015, an article titled Semiautonomous Driving Arrives, Feature by Feature, written by Aaron M. Kessler and Bill Vlasic for the New York Times (online), featured statements from Volvo, Audi, Tesla, and more luxury vehicle manufacturers, all with similar intent to increase vehicle autonomy within the year. At the time of the article, the then latest iteration of a Chevrolet Malibu had the capability of <i>automatic breaking</i>. Nissan was also mentioned in the article, serving as a more ‘attainable’ example of autonomy in vehicles due to the introduction of technology that monitors the user for drowsiness and urges them to pull over, in their future Maxima model. (Kessler and Vlasic, 2015) </p>

									<p>Five years on, and Tesla shows no sign of stopping their journey to autonomous driving:</p>
									<p style="margin-left: 40px">
										<br>
									<blockquote cite="https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/autopilot">
									<p>All new Tesla cars come standard with advanced hardware capable of providing Autopilot features today, and full self-driving capabilities in the future—through software updates designed to improve functionality over time. (Tesla autopilot, 2019)</p>
										</blockquote>
									<br>

									<p>A bold promise featured on their website, Tesla’s statement can reasonably lead one to think that complete autonomy is near for this particular manufacturer- why else would they confidently create the ability within their current models to be upgraded if they did not intend for modifications within the car’s lifespan? On the same page, Tesla also had this to say about future features:
									<p style="margin-left: 40px">
									<br>
									<blockquote cite="https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/autopilot">
										All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don’t say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets (even without lane markings), manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, and handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed. When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you. (Tesla autopilot, 2019)
										</blockquote>

										<p>A vehicle that drives free of human control, that can navigate with ease, that does it all- the ideal autonomous vehicle. The image of future autonomy is evident in Tesla’s design intent, and a plausible predictor for what is to come due to their track record of striving for advancement and succeeding.</p>

                  <h3>What is the likely impact of Autonomous Vehicles?</h3>

									<p> Despite the overwhelming positivity of vehicle manufacturing conglomerates, autonomous vehicles and their development are restrained by red tape due to overwhelming concerns about safety, which prevents companies like Tesla from being able to put out a concrete date for complete autonomy.  Vehicles have already proven their ability to be destructive; from August 2019 to August 2020, 1,121 road deaths were recorded in Australia. (Bitre.gov.au, 2019) Fatality and the potential for it already exist, so ideally moving forward, the aim is for road safety statistics to improve, not worsen as a result of overcomplicating an already difficult process. Road safety would need to be a guaranteed aspect of autonomous vehicles, something that can only be proven through continued development- something that requires an agreement and change in perception of ethics and legality regarding testing, so as to ensure a positive impact as opposed to a deadly one. (Bellet et al., 2019)<p>

									<p>Impact on safety aside, the sustainability (or lack thereof) of autonomous vehicles can have a severe impact on our world, if left unchecked. In Sustainability Prospects for Autonomous Vehicles : Environmental, Social, and Urban Martin (2019, p. 31) states, ‘the automobile is an industrial product with an uncommonly complex sustainability profile-’, before explaining further the unsustainable model vehicle production currently operates on, from the production of the machines (including materials used), to the environmental damage they create during their long lifespan (air pollution, fuel, etc.). Martin firmly believes that this impact however, can be lessened if moving forward, autonomous vehicles were to be electric based (a more sustainable option). (Martin, 2019)</p>

									<p>One last area of impact to consider would be in regards to driving related jobs that would be made redundant by automation. In America alone, four million driving related jobs (including taxi drivers, truck drivers, public transport), could be in the cross hairs if autonomous vehicles are allowed to operate within these industries. (Simpson, 2017)</p>

									<p>Although this would cut down on labour costs (saving companies money) and potentially improve upon service (no longer held back by human error), and this statistic is based on companies being able to afford autonomous vehicles, the number of human lives that would be negatively affected is enough to cause concern and be mindful of moving forward.</p>

									<h2>How will Autonomous Vehicles affect you?</h2>

									<p>Reflecting upon the above information, I can clearly see both the positives and negatives of autonomous vehicles. When autonomous vehicles hit the market, I’m assuming it would be safe and something I could pick up with ease after the slow introduction of autonomous features (i.e. the safety features mentioned earlier). Ideally, this would make travel safer and less involved for myself, which could open up what I can do on long trips now that my focus won’t be on the road. No longer getting lost or planning ahead, it would definitely streamline my travelling experience. That being said though, having learned to drive as a teenager, it would be odd to relinquish my hold on the wheel. I wonder what it would be like to teach my niece or nephew to drive, or my own child if I were to have them. Would they have to face the same lessons I did? Would the road rules be the same for them? I’m not entirely sure. </p>

									<p>As for family, I could see this helping my grandparents or my parents as they age. Regardless of their physical condition, their driving would be safe and not impeded upon by difficulties that can come with age. I do not have any family members that work in a driving related role, so I know they would not be directly affected but can definitely see the potential redundancy autonomous vehicles could create if allowed to dominate said industry.</p>
