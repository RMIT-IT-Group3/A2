          <b>On Wednesday, 7th October 2020, we interviewed Keith Kerr, who is a penetration tester for Telstra.</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>What does a typical day in your role look like?</h2>
          <p>User awareness training is probably the simplest service that we have, through to social engineering - phishing campaigns and over-the-phone or face-to-face social engineering. Physical site compromises, which is looking to go into a standard office and finding out if we can get into that office by any means necessary – can we clone access cards, pick locks, shoulder surf through the crowds, social engineer our way into restricted areas – all for the purpose of exfiltrating whatever information or gain access to systems, planting devices to connect out or record information.</p>
          <p>Our main core services is penetration testing, which is essentially ethical hacking, which is looking to expose any technical vulnerabilities in systems or processes or even sometimes people and how they interact with or use those systems in order to exploit and gain control of information or systems.</p>
          <p>Final core service is Red Team which is a mix of social engineering, penetration testing and physical site compromise. It is a blunt-force, no-holds-barred attack whereby all you’ll get is the name of the company. Nothing is off-limits and you have to attack the system in any way you can.</p>

          <h2>What kind of people do you intereact with on a daily basis in your role?</h2>
          <p><i>Internal stakeholders</i> – Sales, business development managers, account executives.</p>
          <p><i>Client interaction</i> - Technical staff (remediation activities and advice).</p>
          <p><i>C-Suite</i> - To provide a breakdown of the work you have been engaged to do.</p>
          <p>There is also a property team within Telstra that we have developed a relationship with that has allowed us to leverage other teams. We work with the IOT team to use their tech (such as hidden cameras on engagement) and we essentially trial and proof different systems for them. They get the benefit of feedback from the engagements, and we get the benefit of using their tech.</p>

          <h2>What do you enjoy most about your role?</h2>
          <p>Red Team was a capability that I introduced when I joined Telstra and then off the back of that, we introduced the black team which is purely for physical assessment. There is quite a thrill in being able to compromise a system. There’s also a thrill in being able to compromise a person - reading verbal and non-verbal clues and reactions (do they react to dominance or submission) and thinking on the fly to come up with a technique or tactic to get what we need from that person.</p>

          <h2>Where do you do most of your work?</h2>
          <p>We worked remotely even prior to COVID. Even physical assessments are done remotely. A lot of collaboration across different teams – not stuck in one place with limited interaction.</p>

          <h2>What aspect of your role is the most challenging?</h2>
          <p>All engagements are short – a pen test can take between four days to six weeks - so each situation is different. There is a constant learning cycle because there are new techs and processes every time. There is a reset for each engagement so you are starting from scratch each time. You can apply the same techniques but you have to build a presence and compromise each system from scratch every time.</p>

          <h2>What are some positives and negatives of the job?</h2>
          <p>A frustration point is the ongoing education of sales teams. It’s difficult because we are heavily involved in pre-sales and customer service and providing a high-level and brief explanation of each aspect of the engagement – many customers will have heard of a vulnerability test and a penetration test but not many will know the difference between the two. Being involved with pre-sales and customers means that we have to step away from what we love, which is the job itself.</p>
          <p>The thrill of working on high-profile systems that have been compromised and you know that you’ve contributed to making it safer and more secure is really rewarding.</p>

          <h2>What is something that relates to your current career that you wished you’d focused more on at university?</h2>
          <p>I studied a networking and cyber security degree. In hindsight, there wasn’t a high level of security in that degree that I undertook. University did provide a grounding for the C-suite-level conversations that I have, and also gave me a broad understanding of security which is really important in my role.</p>
          <p>What I wish I had focused more on was the practical elements because my job is practical in every sense, and also diving in from an earlier age.</p>

          <h2>What advice would you give to an IT professional just beginning their career?</h2>
          <p>It depends if you have a focus on what you want to be. If you have a chance, get experience across a wide range of roles and shadow other professional in real-time workplace environments. It gives you a more practical idea of what the role entails. Networking was far more repetitive and one- dimensional than my romanticized notions were, whereas my role now is much more dynamic and diverse.</p>
          <p>Some people want to be an expert in one field and there are solutions-based roles for that, where you can develop your skills and knowledge to become an expert. If you know what you want to do, then speak to people in the industry, go to meet-ups, ask them what skills they believe you would need in five to ten years.</p>
          <p>University does not prepare you to hit the ground running on day one. The best way to get ahead is to learn from others in the field and get as much experience as you can.</p>
          <p>University degrees do not help with getting people jobs in my field. We will sit a person down with an environment that we’ve created (not too challenging but not too trivial either) and ask them to compromise it. Prepare practically.</p>

          <h2>What prompted you to get into IT, and specifically penetration testing?</h2>
          <p>Immigrating from Scotland, I knew that I would need a long term career and IT was something that I’d always had an interest in and was reasonably adept in. I had a programming and a networking background. I finished my degree and went into networking engineering. After six months, I found  it too repetitive and not challenging me enough so I created an opportunity to move to the offensive security team (Red Team) and I loved it. I worked hard to contribute and learn as much as I could and I could push for a role in this field, and I got it. Since then, I drove myself to continue researching, learning from peers, attending meet-ups and security events, a lot of on the job experience and certifications, until I was promoted to the senior role and now, we are driving capability for Telstra purple across Australia.</p>

          <h2>What are some of the IT tools and technology that you use daily?</h2>
          <p>Pen testing requires some kind of programming and scripting background. If you can write an exploit in Python or C++ and can make it work, then it doesn’t matter about having a specific language background. The important thing is understanding the fundamentals of a programming language because once you have a grounding in a specific language, you can adapt pretty quickly to using others. Source code reviews or you’re actually delving into the core of an application to understand how it works requires more specific knowledge.</p>
          <p>Other tools that we use are Burke Suite, which is a web proxy that enables us to write all the traffic through the proxy so we can inspect it as it comes through, or intercept it and manipulate it in order to cause errors in the system or application itself.</p>
          <p>Kali Linux is the default pen test suite that anyone can download so you can have a play around. There’s also a lot of bug bounty programs or free hacking platforms used for educational purpose, such as TryHackMe, Hack the Box, Pen Tester Labs, that you can connect into to try and compromise predefined boxes vulnerabilities.</p>
          <p>Even the smartest people in hacking use Google because you’re not going to know how to compromise any application end to end. Over time, you will build up your arsenal of things but it will be continually depleted by updates and advancements to technologies and patches – things that are vulnerable this week might not be vulnerable next week. Keeping current is crucial otherwise you will get left behind.</p>
