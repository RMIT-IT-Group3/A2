										<h1>Industry Data Report - ICT Manager</h1>

                  <h2>Ideal Job </h2>
                  <p>Using the industry data supplied by Burning Glass Technologies, my ideal job can be classed as an IT Manager, also referred to as an ICT Manager (Burning Glass International 2018). An IT Manager occupation ranked as #10 in the Top Burning Glass Occupations report, published in 2018 (Burning Glass International 2018). The Australian Government Job Outlook website estimates that there were approximately 48,400 employees in ICT Manager positions in 2019 (Australian Government n.d.).</p>

                  <h2>IT-Specific Skills</h2>
                  <p>Many ICT Manager positions require candidates to have experience or proficiency with several specialised IT-specific skills, including knowledge of SQL and Microsoft Windows. While the position is heavily focused on project management, it can also require business management and relationship building skills.<br>
                  The 3 core IT-specific skills – project management, SQL, and Microsoft Windows – are ranked within the top 5 skills in greatest demand by Burning Glass Technologies (Burning Glass International 2018).</p>
                  <p>Among the list of Burning Glass Technologies’ IT-specific skills in greatest demand (Burning Glass International 2018), the highest ranked skills an ICT Manager position may not require include the ability to use programming languages JavaScript and JAVA or knowledge of SAP.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>General Skills</h2>
									<p>An ICT Manager position relies heavily on the employee being an effective team leader, which draws from proficient organisational, planning and leadership skills, and facilitating and engaging in teamwork or collaboration. ICT Managers need to effectively communicate, demonstrate problem-solving abilities, and be a proficient writer; they also require presentation skills.<br>
                  Most of these general or baseline skills fall within the top 10 skills in greatest demand as researched by Burning Glass Technologies (Burning Glass International 2018) and share similarities with some IT-specific skills, specifically project management.</p>
									<p>In relation to the highest ranked general or baseline skills studied by Burning Glass Technologies (Burning Glass International 2018), an ICT manager may not require the ability to troubleshoot at a high level or demonstrate detail-orientation or creativity in their work.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?</h2>
									<p>After reviewing the industry data, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. I believe the skills required to become an ICT manager, specifically the general or baseline skills covered, are in very high demand by employers across a range of industries, not just the IT sector. While these skills run parallel with managing IT projects, having a proficiency with or study background of SQL and Microsoft Windows, as well as knowledge of programming languages, will ensure a potential candidate is well-equipped to work within IT businesses such as game studios or software production companies.</p>
