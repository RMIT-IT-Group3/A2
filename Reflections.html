					<b>We were asked to reflect, as individuals and as a group, on how well we think we performed as a group in this assignment.</b>
					<br>
					<hr class="major"/>

					<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Andrew B</h3>
					<p>Our team has successfully created a positive working relationship in which we distributed and assisted in the various tasks of the assignment fairly. This relationship came about through openly discussing and brainstorming ideas through the Microsoft Teams application in video chats and even voting in polls so that any decisions were made as a majority. It has been a pleasant experience to work in this team as the individual members were quite understanding and forthcoming when it came to any scheduling and deadline issues due to personal or professional life interference.</p>
					<p>Upon reflection of my contribution and activity within the group I believe I should take further steps to manage my time between my other commitments, such as personal and work life, and the commitments of my work in the team. It was particularly difficult adjusting in later weeks of the project with my suddenly changed work schedule and the time difference between my group members due to daylight savings time. I attempted to counteract my absences from team video meetings by being active in the teams chat as well as reading the summary of the meetings to make sure I would not miss important actions.</p>
					<p>A nice surprise for me in this team was how naturally people fell into roles such as team leading or project organisation as my previous experience in group work has seen either power struggles or no one willing to uptake any responsibilities.</p>
					<p>I have learnt how flexible a group and its members can be. My tendency to expect 200 percent from myself and to be on time or ahead on any work leads to stress and disappointment if I do not deliver. This team made me feel at ease if I were behind or unable to attend as they understood the issues and had faith that my work would be completed.</p>

					<h3>Christopher D</h3>
					<p>I am very satisfied with the way our group has worked together on this assessment and the quality of the work we have produced.</p>
					<p>We were able to effectively communicate and discuss ideas, tasks and concerns through Microsoft Teams, where we ran weekly meetings and maintained a regular group chat. We efficiently broke down and distributed sections of the assessment between members, with individuals producing quality work and actively assisting with other member’s tasks and sections, contributing ideas or feedback where appropriate. Overall, the workload was evenly distributed between the group.</p>
					<p>As the team leader, I felt I could have been more prepared for our weekly meetings and discussions by creating an agenda ahead of time – I could have also requested feedback from the group to be addressed in the meetings, such as ideas or concerns they may have had.</p>
					<p>I was surprised by how useful Microsoft Teams has been in all aspects of our group work, as well as the features we were able to utilise. In addition to the chat channel and video meetings we commonly used, we were able to record meetings, upload and edit individual or group files, plan and allocate tasks to the group of individual members, and schedule meetings with reminders for the team.</p>
					<p>Finally, I have learnt how impactful it can be to have group members that are active, able and willing contributors to a project. I have felt that we were able to overcome challenges or concerns through effective communication, hard work and a shared commitment to the project.</p>

					<h3>Matt F</h3>
					<p>Our group was formed early in the course and Microsoft teams was established as our communication method from the very beginning. This allowed everyone to introduce themselves and establish some rapport, video conferencing was especially helpful in this regard. Out team has had a very cohesive approach with very little friction and a generally relaxed and friendly approach to getting the job done.</p>
					<p>While I feel that we have worked together as a team extremely well, on reflection perhaps we could have agreed and established formats and structure for individual reports at an earlier point rather than individually completing our assigned tasks and then combining and formatting at the end of the project. Thankfully, our team dynamic has been positive and helpful, so I do not believe that there has been any friction around this.</p>
					<p>I have been pleasantly surprised at how smoothly this process had gone. Any group work can present challenges, let alone working in a group of individuals with a diverse range of backgrounds, experience, goals and personal pressures.</p>
					<p>I’ve learnt that group culture can be effectively formed through online tools such as Microsoft Teams. Through multiple communications methods such a video and text our team has formed a cohesive group that has perhaps functioned even more effectively then had we been a traditional in-person team.</p>

					<h3>Natalie J</h3>
					<p>We formed our group early on, and it was obvious from the outset that we would perform well as a group. Each decision that we have made, from which communication tool we would use to the template design we chose, has been made efficiently, respectfully and fairly. Time zones had the potential to hinder our overall performance as a team, but through open and transparent communication, we were able to navigate these difficulties with ease.</p>
					<p>Upon reflection, I believe the only thing that we could improve upon would be defining the formats and structures for our content earlier than we did. This has caused a slight delay at the end of the project as we try to reformat the pages to have them looking cohesive.</p>
					<p>What I have found surprising is the ease of which we have all come together as a team. There has been even contribution from each team member with no friction or tension. The level of support for one another has been fantastic to see.</p>
					<p>What I have learned about groups is that it works best when everyone is able to be heard. Even though we had a clear team leader, who did a fantastic job of managing behind-the-scenes issues, everyone had an opportunity to share their ideas and thoughts, and it came together to create a really positive and collaborative environment.</p>

					<h3>Thomas H</h3>
					<p>Since the formation of FlickDev Group, the ability and willingness of the members to work together has been highlighted and displayed excellently by the creation of a good working relationship to produce a working forum to achieve the desired result. Any problems or doubts have been cleared up by the use of questions and answers in the FlickDev Group chat facility in Microsoft Teams. I have found this to be a good method of communicating my ideas and being able to review and grasp the groups thinking on our assignment.</p>
					<p>No improvement is obvious, as the group appears to be working well together with strong leadership displayed by Christopher Duncan our elected Team Leader.</p>
					<p>I'm surprised at how well the team has melded together to produce what I believe to be a coherent and informative report so far within the such a short timeframe. This is highlighted by the different time zones team members live in and a willingness by all the team to make sure that everyone is included in group discussions and tasks.</p>
					<p>Since I've started working within FlickDev Group, I have learnt that there are different views and ideas relating to this subject and report writing which has helped me develop a better understanding of the subject matter and report writing.</p>
					<p>I believe that GitHub Desktop and Atom have been a godsend to allow for clear concise passage of information between all group members, which when used to its full capacity will allow us to complete the assignment within the time and required parameters.</p>

					<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
					<p>As a group, we have so far had a mostly positive experience in working on this group project.</p>
					<p>Adopting Microsoft Teams early on has proven to be extremely useful to our group; through the shared chat function and weekly or bi-weekly video meetings, we were quickly able to establish a friendly rapport between all members. This then led to the creation of a positive, cohesive and generally friction-free working environment, with each member adopting a relaxed and friendly approach to completing the project. With each member using open and transparent communication, we were able to fairly distribute tasks between the group, brainstorm ideas, provide and build upon constructive feedback, and help resolve scheduling or time zone challenges that occurred throughout the weeks. </p>
					<p>Through our work as a group, we have identified several areas that could be improved upon for our upcoming projects.</p>
					<p>We believe that at the beginning of the project, it would have been beneficial to clearly identify a shared format and structure for the individual components, rather than attempting to compile and format all these components as one piece toward the end of the project. Establishing a common format and structure would save considerable time in proof reading and ensuring the final report and website appear cohesive. We also recognised that some organisational aspects of our group work, such as detailed agendas for group meetings, could be improved on to help tasks run smoother and more efficiently.</p>
					<p>While there are always many surprises when working as a group on a project, as a group we have been pleasantly surprised by how well our team has formed and melded together. We were able to easily and smoothly form a team and designate a team leader, with each member providing even contribution and actively supporting other members of the group. We were also surprised by our ability to quickly establish and develop a friendly rapport within the group, which has helped to create a positive and relaxed working environment.</p>
					<p>Through our work and collaboration, we have learnt that groups work best when everyone can be heard effectively and allowed the opportunity to collaborate. We have discovered how effective online tools like Microsoft Teams are in helping to create a cohesive group and contribute to a positive work environment. We have also learnt that there are multiple methods to complete tasks and address challenges, and promoting a group culture of respectful, understanding, active and willing contributors is extremely important in creating a project that we can take pride in.</p>
					<p>During our group work, we frequently used Microsoft teams to host weekly video chats; discuss ideas and project work; allocate tasks; create; share; edit and contribute to files; and to regularly check in with one another during the progress of the task. We also utilised GitHub to work as a team on our website, allowing each member to create individual pages or make changes to other sections where necessary. We believe the artifacts provided from our Microsoft Teams channel in the Microsoft Teams report and our GitHub audit trail accurately reflect our team’s shared commitment, dedication and hard work in contributing to this project.</p>
