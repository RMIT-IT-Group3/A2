						<h2>Personal Information</h2>
						<p>My name is Christopher James Duncan, and I am a 28-year-old RMIT student that works full time as a customer service representative and technician at a major IT retailer. My hobbies include PC gaming, reading, playing the drums, making music with friends, and chilling out at home with my partner and our kitten, Yen.</p>
						<p>I have always had a keen interest in learning and understanding how IT products work and function together and how the technology can benefit individuals, groups and cultures. Most of my experience in IT comes from my current employment, which involves determining and troubleshooting problems with IT products or systems and configuring these aspects to suit customerâ€™s needs.</p>

						<h2>Team Profile</h2>
						<p>From my individual Personal Profile assessment, I undertook an online Myers-Briggs personality test, a learning style test, and a leadership style test.</p>

						<h3>Myer-Briggs Personality Test</h3>
						<p>The personality test indicated that I am an <b>Advocate</b> personality, who see great cause in helping others achieve goals and work with determination and passion.</p>
						<p>I believe an Advocate personality is a huge benefit to a team or group in approaching challenges or ideas in a unique, creative way; their determination and passion will ensure they work effectively at individual tasks and contribute to projects. Advocates will be sensitive and respectful towards group members, helping facilitate a constructive and harmonious environment: through their empathy, Advocates will offer support and assistance to other group members who are struggling or facing individual problems.</p>

						<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
						<p>The learning style test suggests that I primarily learn in the <b>Pragmatist</b> style, where learning is most effective using practical examples, case studies and discussions.</p>
						<p>In a group or team environment, a Pragmatist learner will likely be ready to jump into tasks or challenges, especially if they have had previous experience with the work. Pragmatists will function best with group tasks by visually breaking down ideas and challenges in a clear manner, such as by creating a timeline or list of tasks to complete, and by establishing effective communication to address any questions or concerns during project work.</p>

						<h3>Leadership Style Test</h3>
						<p>The leadership style test determined that I most suit the <b>Postmodern</b> leadership style, which is an altruistic style in the way that leaders can bring joy to others by their role.</p>
						<p>A Postmodern leader can help create an open, constructive and upbeat team environment, encouraging team members to apply their ideas, skills and knowledge to create positive change in the world. With a focus on the wellbeing of the team, Postmodern leaders will strive to create a safe working environment and will be respectful and considerate in all aspects. They will help develop a welcoming and safe work culture, where team members feel comfortable in discussing issues or problems and having them resolved successfully.</p>

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						<p>I am currently interested in studying to become an IT or ICT Manager.</p>
						<p>I believe an ICT Manager is an individual who leads an manages a team of dedicated staff in developing and maintaining IT resources within a business or organisation. They would need to communicate with other teams or departments, discuss and present new ideas or changes, and maintain the well-being of the IT team. An ICT Manager would need extensive knowledge of IT systems and the way they interact, the ability to successfully lead and manage a team, and be a strong and effective communicator.</p>
						<p>This role appears to me because I am confident in my existing knowledge and my ability to effectively communicate with various parties to provide solutions, as well as demonstrate valuable conflict resolution and team management skills.</p>
