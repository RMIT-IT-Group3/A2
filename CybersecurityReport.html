									<b>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?.</b>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p>Cybersecurity as a major component in Information Technology (I.T.) is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and other devices from any kind of digital attack or compromise.</p>
									<p>Its importance is gauged by the need to detect, ascertain the threat and ultimately prevent the theft and expensive cost in terms of data loss, proprietary loss and loss of trust when client and staff personal information is placed in the hands of criminals or competitors in similar industries.The outcome of these attacks and threats is the possible loss of clientele through mistrust in their network security, loss of business due to rivals undercutting price or offering a better deal, or even ruination due to legal action by clients, governing bodies or even competitors depending on the information lost. Conversely, there is the potential for false information to be inserted rendering normal business activities useless. Another outcome could the insertion of Viruses, Malware, and Trojan software designed to harm or destroy the computing network altogether.</p>
									<p>Communications via the Internet is now the state of the art networking, whereas in the past, networks were a combination of computers connected to a standalone mainframe with little or no connection to the outside world. Previously access to the mainframe was from within the host complex or via hardwired terminals connected to it. Nowadays Servers, Networks, The Cloud in various forms and personal computers can be accessed from the other side of the world by nearly anyone with computing skills and the correct software. Cybersecurity has had to and must continue to rapidly evolve to combat the threats posed by the attempts to infiltrate these systems. </p>
									<p>Cybersecurity experts have developed many varied way to protect systems nowadays with two of the more notable methods being Authentication and Authorisation.</p>
                  <p>Authentication is the process of identifying who the User actually is and deciding if the User is a human or computer software, commonly known as a Robot. This process uses identity markers such as Username, email address or a set of numbers associated with the person, organisation or account. One commonly used method of doing this is by having a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This means that the user must go through two layers of security, example: by typing in a predetermined Personal Indentification Number (PIN) where indicated and scanning a programmed Security Card to allow legal and controlled access to the areas or information required. </p>
									<p>Authorisation is the process of controlling what the user is able to access, change or view on that network, system or account. This uses technical controls making sure the correct and legal User is connecting to and accessing the relevant information allowed at that time.</p>
									<p>Data is now stored and accessed from various devices such as Hard Disk Drives, USB Flash Drives, Disk, on a Server, or through the network via a process referred to as Data In Transit, which is data being transferred via cables or wireless. One of the best ways to protect this data is by using Encryption Tools which scrambles the data so that anyone without the authorisation can't see or access that data. One method using this encryption is IPsec (Internet Protocol Security). IPsec is a group of protocols that set up an encrypted connection between devices, providing a very secure and trusted safety net. It uses Authentication to verify that the data that was received was sent from the claimed sender, Integrity to ensure that the data didn't get changed whilst in transit, and Confidentiality to conceal the data through encryption.</p>
									<p>To verify and ensure the ongoing protection of a system, experts in the IT field trained as Penetration Testers are employed to electronically attack a system to find the weak points with the view to exploiting them to gain access or at least show the vulnerabilities. They are skilled in the use of various tools to devise a system to better protect a network or system once a vulnerability is found or perceived to exist. These tools are, but not limited to, Linux, Python, SQL (Structured Query Language), JavaScript, website production, software engineering, Microsoft Windows, C#, Java and git; just to name a few of the tools and languages being used.</p>
								  <p>From my research and advise from within the IT industry, it appears that cybersecurity looks to be moving towards automation with a heavy focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help protect and secure systems and networks that will be able to monitor, detect and prevent cyber attacks. </p>

									<b>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</b>
<br>
<br>

									<p>Cybersecurity has made a major impact in IT for businesses and the everyday users of the internet by protecting against unwanted intrusion. With the addition of Wired Local Area Networks (LAN), Wireless Access (WiFi), and the cloud, it has made it a lot easier for users to connect to external networks and to the Internet. This easier access has made it possible for individuals with malicious intent to gain access into those networks and systems with a view to exploiting any weakness to steal or corrupt the sensitive data during transfer or storage. This is called a data breach, which has been defined by TechTarget as "an incident in which sensitive, protected or confidential data has potentially been viewed, stolen, or used by an individual unauthorized to do so. Data breaches may involve payment card information (PCI), personal health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), trade secrets, or intellectual property" (The History of Data Breaches by Juliana De Groot). </p>
									<p>As time goes on and technology evolves, knowledge of computing systems increases and more personal users and businesses connect to the cloud, networks and the internet, the higher the rate of attacks will occur. In 2020, over one third of all data will pass through or be stored on the cloud, and that data production has been estimated to be around 44 times greater than it was back in 2009. In 2020 alone there has been 540 data breaches with an estimated 163,551,023 individuals affected as stated by CNBC. Cybersecurity is becoming more advanced as time goes on to help protect users systems and personal details.</p>
                  <p>Data breaches can and will affect everyone, from the everyday user or business, with data such as passwords, bank details, social security details, client information, etc. being stolen or corrupted. This can have a drastic effect on companies with the loss of clients and/or their data; or by suffering downtime whilst the situation is investigated, reviewed, corrected, and then business resumed as normal. Some of the biggest Internet names, such as Facebook, Adobe, Ebay and LinkedIn, have had disastrous data breaches with their clients’ data and details being stolen and then displayed on the Web without the clients consent or knowledge. These breaches have had consequences far beyond the displaying of the material with significant financial loss suffered by some, with privacy invaded causing in some cases health issues from stress and even suicide. </p>
									<p>With the increase of users and consequently abusers on the cloud and internet, this creates more opportunities and employment in the Cybersecurity field, with positions such as Penetration Testers (Pen Tester) being in high demand due to the shortage of trained, skilled, qualified Pen Testers. As automation of computing and computer security through AI increases, the basic Computer Technician will need to increase their skills and level of expertise to advance further or risk falling behind or even redundant. </p>

									<b>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b>
<br>
<br>
									<p>My mum is a complete novice when it comes to using a computer, but she is trying to learn more but doesn't know about cybersecurity at all. She is able to turn on her tablet and goes online primarily to look at Facebook which has had data breaches in the past. Other sites visited are gardening, shopping pages, gaming sites such as internet pokies and of course banking and emails. </p>
									<p>Now this effects me more now than before as I have now realised the potential for financial loss and personal data loss for my mum and consequently the rest of my family. My father and sister have more of an idea as they are reluctant to visit suspect sites and currently use Nortons Premium 360 as their Cybersecurity protection. This small awareness still does not afford my father and sister full protection from a cyberattack or tainted emails; it just highlights a little bit of knowledge provides a little bit of safety but also at times complacency.</p>
									<p>Since I have started this course, I have gained a greater appreciation of the possible dangers and pitfalls that are a constant threat to my family and myself through dangerous sites being inadvertently opened and sent via email, links on websites, social media sites such as Facebook, storage devices such as USB flash drives and sharing of computer devices.</p>
									<p>Whilst I see no significant change to my current computer usage at work, at home and at play such as online gaming; I know that I need to be more vigilant in my communications online to prevent a cyber attack from affecting myself. I feel more confident that I can use any small knowledge that I have gained so far and will gain in the future, to further enhance my desire, my skill and my interest in Cybersecurity and subsequently my intended specialised field of Penetration Testing. </p>
									<p>Now by gaining the knowledge attained from this course I know that I, my family, my friends and my future employers will be safer from the possibility of a disastrous cyber attack.</p>
