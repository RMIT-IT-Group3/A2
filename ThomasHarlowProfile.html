						<h2>Personal Information.</h2>
						<p>My name is Thomas Harlow, I'm 36 years old and I work full time at Direct Mail Ontime and study part time with RMIT in Introduction to I.T, I've got several hobbies, I enjoy playing table top Warhammer 40k, I play Magic The Gathering, various board games and many different type of video games with friends, one of my favourite game types are those deceitful games like Trouble in Terrorist town, but I am a terrible liar in those games. I've wanted to go to University for many years now to learn I.T. but it wasn't until the current world crisis that pushed me to finally start learning since my current knowledge is fairly limited when it comes to I.T. </p>

						<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
						<p>The three personality tests I did were the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, the Learning Styles Personality Test and the Leadership Style. </p>
						<p>With the Myers-Briggs Personality Test I got the Entertainer and my overall percentages of everything listed was somewhat in the middle which showed me that I am kinda in the middle when it comes to most things, that I should be able to work with a lot of people pretty effectively while not being too over the top to annoy my team.</p>
						<p>With the Learning Styles Personality Test my highest match was the "Theorist Style" which I'm not sure, I've always been more of a visual learner, but I do like learning the theory behind what I am working or learning and finding background information, and while working with a team I can learn to deep dive into theoritical problems of the project allowing others to focus practical side of troubleshooting, and see if i am suited as a theorist, at this stage i wouldn't like to pigeon hole myself, i'd like to spend time exploring the practical course and build up an even skill set.</p>
						<p>The last personality test i did was the Leadership Style which found me to be a Front-Line leader which i wasn't too sure what that really meant so i read "Seven Simple Strategies for Frontline Leaders" to get a clearer understanding of what a Front-line leader really is and should do, so the test helped me learn more about my leadership style and means i can hopefully help my team. It just showed me that I try and be there with my team and help them with their problems.</p>

						<h2>Ideal Job </h2>
						<p>My Idea Job is a Penetration Tester (Offensive Security) which is an I.T. security specialist that try to hack into networks to find potential vulnerabilities in the system, they've been called "Ethical hackers". My friend is a penetration tester and his stories are what got me interested in I.T, the position is appealing to me because it takes skill and knowledge to hack and find the weak points.</p>
						<p>I currently don't have any of the skills or experience required for the job but that's why I am going to University, to dedicate myself to learning the skills required to be a Penetration Tester.</p>
