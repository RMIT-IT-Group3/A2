					<h2>What does it do? </h2>
					<p>Machine learning is a method of instructing computers to generate predictions from a given data source without specifically writing the code that would directly generate the prediction/outcome (Heath 2018), and has been described as “a
						field of computer science that studies algorithms and techniques for automating solutions to complex problems that are hard to program using conventional programming methods." (Rebala, Ravi & Churiwala 2019, p. 1) </p>
						<p>Machine learning can be used to classify information/data, Cluster data by dividing large data sets into smaller clusters of data – Unlike classifying data, the numbers of clusters may not be known in advance, and finally to make
							predictions by identifying trends in historical data. (Rebala, Ravi & Churiwala 2019) Machine learning primarily uses three learning methods to achieve its results each with a varying amount of human supervision. These three techniques
							are referred to as supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised with supervised learning being employed the most. (Allen 2020) Supervised learning has been described as a “synonym for classification” (Han, Kamber & Pei 2011, p. 24) and
							unsupervised learning a “synonym for clustering” (Han, Kamber & Pei 2011, p. 25).</p>

							<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
							<p>The name “supervised learning" originates from the idea that training this type of algorithm is like having a teacher supervise the whole process.” (Wilson 2019). Supervised machine learning uses two data sets, an input and an output
								that is compared by the machine to identify what links the two sets of data. Once enough data has been processed and a correlation is established new data can be fed into the system to generate predictions based on what had been learnt
								(Allen 2020).</p>
								<p>An example of supervised machine learning in action from springboard.com is that of predicting house prices, in the example, relevant property data such as location number of rooms, living area and land area are collect and
									compared/trained against the actual sale price for the property. Once trained the learning model will be able to predict prices of new home listings (Yagcioglu 2020). These models are commonly employed today by banks and real estate
									listing sites such as the property marker research feature by Westpac (Westpac 2020). </p>

									<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
									<p>Unsupervised machine learning is different from supervised machine learning in that it will “infer patterns from a dataset without reference to known, or labelled, outcomes” (DataRobot 2020). Without labels, unsupervised machine learning
										algorithms are left to their own devices to find structure in the data input (Mishra 2017). </p>
										<p>An example of unsupervised learning, again provided by springboard, details a case where a bank is required to select finance applicants and rank them given their ability to repay the debt. The bank already holds various data on finance
											applicant; income, debt, credit history plus they have access to a larger data set consisting of age, gender, spending habit’s and so on. What is less clear to the bank is what data is relevant in determining the ability of the applicant
											to service the loan. To establish this the bank creates a machine learning feature selection method that inspects all of the previously mentioned data to direct any influence on outcomes, identifying the data that is relevant to the case
											and giving the bank the knowledge to safely ignore data that will not influence the outcome (Yagcioglu 2020).</P>

											<h3>Semi-supervised Learning </h3>
											<p>Semi-supervised learning can be seen as the halfway point between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with semi-supervised algorithms starting with an incomplete set of labelled data. (Rodriguez 2017). “The goal of a
												semi-supervised model is to classify some of the unlabelled data using the labelled information set.” (Rodriguez 2017). Semi-supervised learning is used in applications such as Speech Analysis, medical classifications such as Protein
												Sequence Classification and Web Content Classification (Rodriguez 2017).</P>
												<h3>Progress into the future</h3>
												<p>Machine learning has made great progress recently, particularly in supervised learning methods surrounding perception such as vision, language and speech. The Future and cutting edge technologies will seek to address machine learnings
													current shortcomings with more research into deep active learning and human-in-the-loop learning, controllable generative models and hybrid deep learning (Anandkumar 2020).</P>

													<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
													<p>While machine learning is a technology that can be traced back to origins in the 1949 book The Organisation of Behaviour by Donald Hebb and the development of a computer program for playing checkers by IBM in 1950 (Foote 2019), it is
														only recently, since the 2000’s that large data sets and greater computer power have started to rapidly accelerate its development. </p>
														<p>“Although economic effects of ML are relatively limited today, and we are not facing the imminent “end of work” as is sometimes proclaimed, the implications for the economy and the workforce going forward are profound (Brynjolfsson &
															Mitchell 2017). In the near future, I believe this technology will only serve to improve our lives, providing better data that leads to better decisions. While programmers are responsible generating the original code that enables the
															algorithms to function, I can only see the programming labour market increasing in size to develop bespoke algorithms for any business or body that requires better data. Though that could change rapidly though when the automation itself
															is atomised. </p>
															<p>In the broader workforce machine learning is placed to be a highly disruptive influence with the impact of machine learning said to possibly “rival or exceed that of earlier general-purpose technologies like the internal combustion
																engine or electricity.” (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell 2017). Advancement in computer perception of natural speech and images will further open up areas that computers can expand into such as security guards and police, displacing people
																working in those fields (National Academies of Sciences 2017).</p>

																<h2>How will this affect you? </h2>
																<p>I suspect that machine learning will for the most part be very directly observed, though however will have a great impact on my life and of those around me. As storage devices become larger, network and processing speeds increase, and
																	the collection and storage of data become ever more present there will be fewer and fewer barriers to employing machine learning algorithms in every aspect of our lives. I suspect one of the areas that I will personally benefit from will
																	be health outcomes. Wearable devices such as the apple watch and the health databases such as the My Health Records that are being used to store health data by the Australian government will provide rich sources of data for machine
																	learning algorithms to be used to provide powerful health insights like we have never seen before. </p>
																	<p>Personal productivity will increase as the tools that we use daily such as google maps will better learn what is required to produce the optimal outcome and developers will have access to more data to create digital products to improve
																		our lives in ways we haven't yet considered.</p>
