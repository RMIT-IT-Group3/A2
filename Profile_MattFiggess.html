          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p>I have a background in Graphic Design and Photography with a Diploma of Graphic design and a Graduate Diploma of Creative Industries. I have recently re-evaluated my career aspirations and direction which has led me to peruse my interest
            in IT and commence studying Information Technology at RMIT. The only experience I have in IT was one of my first jobs where I worked for a computer rental company where I imaged returning units and assembled computers to customer
            specifications. My current interest in the IT industry in the software and web development areas rather than hardware. I find the intersection of information, technology and human interaction fascinating, and I believe that we are only
            just starting to explore what is possible. I was born in Fiji, immigrated to Australia at the age of 7 and have lived in Perth WA since I was nine years old. Outside of work, I like to spend time outdoors with my family enjoying
            activities such and bushwalking and discovering the hidden spots that Perth and surrounding areas have to offer.</p>

          <h2>Test Profiles </h2>
          <h3>Myers-Briggs Test: ISTP </h3>
          <p>Working in a team, the Myers Briggs Personality Test indicates that individuals with ITSP personalities are “practical, task-oriented team members” (Truity, The Best Careers for ISTP Personality Types). This pragmatic and practical
            outlook will allow me to focus on the work at hand to assist the team to achieve our best.</p>
          <p><i>“ISTPs or Virtuosos have been identified as enjoying attending to a list of items that need fixing or being attended to.”</i> (16Personalities, 2020).</p>
          <p>I believe this trait will allow me to assist in a teamwork situation as I will enjoy ensuring that our submission meets the requirements of the assigned tasks.</<p>

          <h3>Leadership Style: Contrarian </h3>
          <p>The leadership style test has highlighted that I am not a binary thinker and that I embrace the grey areas allowing me to consider conflicting ideas (Montgomery, 2018). I believe that this personality attribute will be beneficial in a
            team situation. Whenever individuals work together, there are bound to be varied and opposing ideas and points of view. Having the ability to consider each perspective can only lead to better outcomes for the team. The test also indicates
            a propensity to listen to advice from experts which I believe will allow me to be flexible with my direction, changing and adapting it to new ideas and information when needed for a better outcome.</p>

          <h3>Big 5 personality: Empathic Idealist</h3>
          <p>The Big 5 personality test indicates that as an Empathic Idealist, I use “insight and creativity to help others” (Truity, 2020). I believe that empathy and a desire to understand others it a critical aspect of any teamwork and that we
            can all achieve more if we help each other. The Big 5 test also indicates that Empathetic Idealists “spend a lot of time thinking about the needs and experiences of others”  (Truity, 2020). This personality trait helps me empathise with
            other team members and contribute to a friendly and smooth team atmosphere which will help everyone in the group.</p>

          <hr class="major" />
          <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          <p>My ideal job is working as a developer. I am interested in this role as I believe that this position will involve the understanding and implementation of entire projects, from UX research and methods, through to the development of the project using languages (JavaScript, CSS and HTML) and tools (AWS, GIT and Figma) to create finished products. Being involved in and creating projects for the entire process appeals to me as I enjoy creating finished tangible products along with the more analytical and empathic aspects of the user experience process.</p>
