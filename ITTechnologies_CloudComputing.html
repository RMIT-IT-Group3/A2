					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p>The term <b>cloud computing</b> refers to the delivery of a range of computing services – including data storage, servers, databases, software and applications - over the Internet without requiring direct active management by the user. Cloud-based services offer many benefits for both end-users and businesses:</p>
					<p>
						<li>End-users are provided easily accessible platforms they can use to gain and develop new capabilities without having to invest in new hardware or software;</li>
						<li>Businesses can utilise fast, efficient and reliable IT resources at a relative low-cost, with the ability to adjust the security or amount of resources they require in the future.</li>
					</p>
					<p>One of the more widely used examples of cloud computing is a file hosting service such as Dropbox or Google Drive. These services allow users to store files on remote servers, synchronise files across devices, and share files by logging in with a username or password; with a copy of the files being stored on the server, this also acts as a form of data backup for the user. Users receive a certain amount of storage space to use at no cost, but if they exceed that limit, they are required to pay a subscription fee to continue storing files.</p>

					<h3>State of the Art - Serverless Computing</h3>
					<p>With an increasing number of businesses competing online during this rapidly evolving digital age, there is a huge requirement for cheap, efficient & effective IT technologies and resources. Serverless computing has emerged as a new and compelling model of cloud computing that allows businesses to build and deploy applications without needing to manage infrastructure such as physical servers; the serverless computing provider automatically allocates, scales and manages the infrastructure required and only charges for the resources used on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ basis (Castro, P et al. 2019). This model of cloud computing is generally very cost-effective, as users are only paying for the resources they need, when they’re needed; it also offers simplified and rapid scalability to match the demands of the workload. By utilising serverless computing, developers can significantly decrease the time between the development and market release of an application.</p>

					<h3>Cloud Computing Models</h3>
					<p>Cloud computing can be broken down into 3 models that represent the current primary applications of the technology, which are: <b>Infrastructure as a Service</b>; <b>Platform as a Service</b>; and <b>Software as a Service</b> (Amazon, n.d.).</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b> typically provides access to computers, data storage space, servers, networking and security features, and physical data centres over the Internet. Examples of IaaS platforms include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b> provides computing platforms and the development tools required for creating and deploying applications, including programming languages and database management. Examples of PaaS platforms include Salesforce, OpenShift, and Heroku.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b>, which is typically used for web-based applications, delivers software applications over the Internet which are hosted and managed by the cloud provider. Commonly used by end users, popular examples of SaaS platforms include Slack, Dropbox, and Netflix.</p>
						<p>When layered together, these three services are known as the <b>cloud computing stack</b>.</p>

						<h3>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h3>
						<p>By employing cloud computing over traditional infrastructure, businesses, education institutions and governments can achieve significant cost savings; develop, implement and maintain software, applications and services more efficiently and effectively; and access higher levels of security during data storage or access. Cloud computing also allows organisations to structure a workforce in a different capacity, such as enabling employees to work from home, during domestic/international travel, or during a pandemic.</p>
						<p>For users, cloud computing services offer a convenient, simple and secure method of accessing, sharing and backing up data and content; there is an increased ability to learn, train and develop new skills and work from home. Cloud-based accessibility tools such as Recite Me provide users the ability to access websites and content they may not have been able to previously (Recite Me n.d.).</p>

						<h3>Future Developments</h3>
						<p>Many applications of cloud computing are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence to provide seamless, connected and intuitive experiences – think of digital assistants such as Apple’s Siri or Amazon Alexa (Alton, L 2019). AI tools can be used to make large improvements in existing services by streamlining workloads to increase efficiency or providing more sophisticated data analysis; at the same time, cloud computing will be crucial in widening the distribution, development and adoption of AI tools.</p>

						<h3>What has made this possible?</h3>
						<p>From a technological or hardware perspective, the development of cloud computing can be attributed to the increased availability of high-capacity, high-speed networks, paired with low-cost computers and storage devices.</p>
						<p>While evolving technologies like artificial intelligence tools may have a profound effect in the next 10 years (Maguire, J 2019), cloud computing is currently experiencing a huge growth, in both use and development, due to a better understanding of the technology and its benefits (Liu, R 2019).</p>

						<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
						<p>While I have covered some of the benefits cloud computing offers to businesses and users, there are also potential negative impacts as the technology continues to grow.</p>
						<p>As more and more businesses employ cloud computing services, issues may arise over the control, ownership, security and confidentiality of the software, application and data utilised (Leimbach, T et al. 2014). For example, an international cloud service provider with storage centres overseas may be subject to different laws and regulations concerning data privacy, which may not align with a business’ own policies.</p>
						<p>As cloud computing services are delivered over the Internet, network losses may cause significant disruptions to work and loss in profit during downtime (Leimbach, T et al. 2014).</p>
						<p>For users, data privacy and security are key potential issues, as well as the possibility of data loss or abuse of data for advertisements (Leimbach, T et al. 2014). There is also an argument that a heavier reliance on cloud computing is contributing to a growing user dependence on technology, as the boundary lines between work and private life become harder to distinguish.</p>
						<p>As the number and availability of services offered through cloud computing continues to grow, we are likely to see new businesses and organisations - like tech start-up companies or online retailers - have the ability to create, develop and offer new applications, technologies and services. This may lead to an increase in new jobs or specialised workforces.</p>
						<p>While adopting cloud computing services may help ease the support burden on existing IT staff within an organisation, there may be a negative impact on workforces that offer installation and maintenance of physical IT infrastructure.</p>
						<p>Rather than replacing or making redundant existing technologies and services, cloud computing is revolutionising the accessibility, effectiveness and flexibility of these resources, as well as promoting the growth and development of new technologies.</p>

						<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
						<p>If questioned about cloud computing, I personally would struggle to accurately estimate how many cloud services I use daily. Cloud computing has become such an integral part of my life and has contributed change to the way I work, how I spend leisure time, and how I study.</p>
						<p>As an example, I have greatly benefited from the use of Slack in my workplace, a cloud-based messaging platform, to quickly communicate and share content with a large number of work colleagues across Australia – it is fast, convenient, and a great tool for sharing ideas and knowledge.</p>
						<p>As cloud computing continues to grow and more services move to a cloud-based platform, I anticipate the way that I communicate and access, share and modify content will become increasingly easier, more convenient and accessible. This will apply to my work and private life.</p>
						<p>As new technologies and services are introduced via cloud computing, or existing ones migrated to cloud-based platforms, this will present an opportunity to learn new skills and develop my knowledge of IT systems. It will allow me to critically examine how I learn and work to determine if there is a more effective method I could learn and apply.</p>
						<p>My family members and friends already greatly benefit from using cloud-based services to communicate and share ideas and content. They also utilise cloud storage services to safely back up personal data.</p>
						<p>One of the main concerns I have in relation to the growth of cloud computing, for both myself, my family and friends, is the safety, security and integrity of our personal data. As more services move online and an increasing amount of our data is collected, I believe cloud providers have an ethical responsibility to safely and securely store and protect the data they have access to; they should be responsible for ensuring the data is not sold for profit or provided to organisations without explicit consent from the user; and, most importantly, they should treat users with respect and consideration in all matters.</p>
