						<h1>Industry Data Report<h1>
								<h2>Web Development</h2>

					<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
					<p>According to Burning Glass Technologies top IT job titles list of 2018, Web Developer ranks at the 15th most advertised positions with 381 listing out 120,353 IT related listings (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) 2018a).
						Strong growth is forecast for the position with a current industry size of 8,600 workers (joboutlook.gov.au 2020).</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>IT-Specific Skills </h2>
					<h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
					<p>The required skills for a web developer are HTML, JavaScript, CSS, GIT, AWS, React JS, WordPress and Wireframing tools such as Figma (Seek.com.au 2020). In addition, spinxdigital also list JAVA, PYTHON, SQL, PHP, .NET and ANGULAR as some
						of the most common languages used in web development (www.spinxdigital.com 2020).</p>
					<p>SQL, JavaScript and JAVA are the top three highest ranked skills on the list with .NET, Git and Python appearing at 16th, 21st and 22nd respectively. The rest of the required skills appear to have been grouped into a single category
						website production which ranks at the 17th most in demand skill in the Burning Glass specialised skills list. (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) 2018c).</p>

					<h3> What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
					<p>The three most in demand skills that are not in the required skill set for a Web Developer appear to be more generic skills such as Microsoft Windows, Project Management and SAP. (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) 2018c)
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>General Skills</h2>
					<h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
					<p>In an article published on Toward Data Science, Danielle Fontani lists the top ten soft skills for a developer as communication, flexibility, listening, creativity, teamwork, negotiation, presentation, mentoring, determination and
						leadership (Fontani 2020). Six of which explicitly appear in the top 18 Burning Glass skills list. Broadly I would categorise all of these skill into people management skills which is reflective of the need to engage with clients,
						stakeholders and team members on diverse projects form initial brief through to production. (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) 2018b)</p>
					<h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
					<p>The three highest skills that have not been identified in the required skill set are problem solving, organisation skills and writing which are ranked as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sought sought after skills. Though I would argue that while
						not explicitly stated as required skill they are indeed critical to being successful in any IT position.</p>

					<hr class="major" />
					<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
					<h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
					<p>Having reviewed the data from burning glass my opinion of my ideal job hasn’t changed, as I feel that web development is a role I would enjoy because to be successful as a web developer requires utilising a wide range of skills and
						technologies in addition to traditional coding languages required soley to development. Working in a broad position such a web development will allow me to employ the top five burning glass baseline skills, communication, problem solving,
						organisational skills, writing and teamwork/collaboration. </p>
					<p>Though while my opinion of my idea job has not yet changed due to the burning glass data it had highlighted the need to ensure I have a solid grounding in software development / database languages. Specialised skills such as SQL, JAVA,
						SAP, C# and Python rank highly in the burning glass data, so ensuring that I have I solid understanding of these technologies on completion of my student career will give me added flexibility and range of options when it comes time to
						enter the IT job market should I choose to apply for positions that appear to be more highly sought after such as .Net developer or JAVA developer. (Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) 2018c)</p>
