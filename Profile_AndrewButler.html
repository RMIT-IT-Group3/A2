					<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					<p>Hey there! My name is Andrew Butler let me tell you a bit about me!</p>
					<p>I am 26, live in sunny Queensland and I am terrible at dancing!</p>
					<p>Ok, I’ll be a bit more serious from here on.</p>

          <p>My professional Background is in news media, currently working for Nine News in its regional studio department editing video and various other studio tasks to help organise the bulletins.  I consider myself lucky having the opportunity to work and excel in my work environment without any formal qualifications on paper however I have come to the realisation that I no longer wish to work in such an industry and such want to pursue a larger interest in Information Technology.  Born and raised in Brisbane Australia I still reside here however I do wish to one day have the opportunity to live and work in another country. I spend my free time currently relaxing at home with my fiancé and cats while waiting to be able to travel the world again. With little IT experience beside general computing I recently began taking a keen interest to the multifaceted IT systems that I use at work on a daily basis, how they operate, The tools used to create said systems and programs, most importantly how could the user experience be improved. My interest in IT is not on one specific field but rather in the aim of understanding, implementing and improving IT concepts to adjust my focus to any IT based career path.</p>

					<h2>Team Profile</h2>


					<h3>Myer-Briggs Personality Test : - INFP-T - Turbulent Mediator</h3>
					<p>Mediator types are said to be dedicated and considerate employees, or in this case group members, and feel most motivated when thinking of ways to help others. I believe this the most appropriate information in regards to my position in this group and what I have to offer during this time as I do often find myself at work more likely to excel in tasks that benefit or support another member of my team in some way. </p>


					<h3>VARK learning style test</h3>
					<p>The Visual Aural Read/write and Kinesthetic test results show me to have a learning preference to kinesthetic learning, this means within group work I prefer may prefer a “hands on” approach to learning and interacting with our assessment. This preference however is not much use in the current situation as we are unable to meet up physically. </p>

					<h3>Hogan Personality Inventory</h3>
					<p>Within the Hogan personality inventory I scored a 10 out of 10 in the Quickness category, this category reflects how much I value education and as I high scorer I am to be insightful and focused on my interest, I believe his insightful trait along with a focused interest on the project may be beneficial to my group during the assessment.</p>

					<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
          <p>As I am unsure really of where within IT I want to go for my ideal job I chose a field that currently interests me and then decided to aim high. My ideal job is a cyber security specialist of which would involve advising decisions and solutions for security requirements across many teams and projects within a company. The job role would obviously require many years of prior experience and knowledge of complex systems which is why I thought it important to pick such a role as to give myself a road map of sorts to follow if this in indeed the job role that I aim for in my future. I believe they problem solving and team oriented designing within this job increase the likelihood of my own job satisfaction.</p>
